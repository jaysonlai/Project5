The task at hand involved being able to implement code that would be 
centered around having a provided txt file that contained a list of 
words we would use to compare the hamming distance between a chosen word 
with the rest of the list, while also being able to add in new words 
per each run time of the java program. Our main tasks included:
1. Being able to create a graphical interface closely resembling the one 
provided in the example.
2. Being able to implement multiple elements such as a scrollpane, 
combobox, labels, and multiple buttons to display input information from 
the user and txt file.
3. Being able to display the hamming distance measurements in the gui
My approach to the Project invovled:
1. Declaring variables that would be needed based on the provided 
example
2. Creating a method to set the buttons and the actionlisteners needed 
for them to function
3. Setting the various jlabels needed to display hamming dist values
4. Setting a method for creating a slider for the given value to be used 
and inputted in the slider
5. Setting the text field that would display the added word the user 
would request
6. setting a method to declare the size of the frame for the panel to be 
inserted into
7. create a method to import a picture into the free zone that we are 
allowed to use.
8. reading in the txt file into a jcombobox through a method
9. building our constructor to add all methods and Components to a panel 
to be added to the frame to be displayed.
10. Adding in additonal comments and debugging the code
Overall the methods in this project included: setTextFields which 
created the boundaries for the hamming distance count for a word and for 
adding a word, setSlider for setting the value on the hamming distance 
slider, setButtons which sets the action listeners for each button, 
setCB which adds the txt file into a dropdown box, setFrame which sets 
the size of the window for the program, setPicture inserts a image into 
the frame.
